### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in the UK, specializing in package management, and mining open-source data, ruby and rails. My current focus is [Ecosyste.ms](https://github.com/ecosyste-ms), a project that leverages my experience in package management and open data analysis to map dependencies across OSS ecosystems, highlighting the most critical projects in need of support.

Ecosyste.ms builds upon concepts from a previous project that I built, [libraries.io](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io) (since sold to Tidelift), expanding the data coverage and API capabilities to enable deeper analysis of open-source ecosystems. It offers a comprehensive foundation for researchers and funders to better understand and prioritize key open-source projects.

I also created [Octobox](https://github.com/octobox/octobox), a tool to help maintainers manage GitHub notifications effectively, and [24 Pull Requests](https://github.com/24pullrequests/24pullrequests), an initiative encouraging developers to contribute to open source throughout December.

Iâ€™m always eager to connect with fellow developers, explore new ideas, and find ways to support the health and sustainability of open-source software.

Feel free to reach out or explore my projects below!
