### Hey 👋

I'm a software engineer based in the UK, mostly working with Ruby. I’ve spent over a decade working in the world of package management and software dependencies — building tools to make open source more understandable, discoverable, and sustainable.

These days I’m focused on [Ecosyste.ms](https://github.com/ecosyste-ms), a project that maps dependency networks across open-source ecosystems to identify the projects that really matter — the ones everything else relies on. It builds on ideas from [Libraries.io](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io), which I started and later sold to Tidelift, and takes the concept further with broader data coverage and deeper analysis.

I also created [Octobox](https://github.com/octobox/octobox), which helps developers manage GitHub notifications, and [24 Pull Requests](https://github.com/24pullrequests/24pullrequests), an initiative to encourage open-source contributions during December.
