### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [Ecosyste.ms](https://github.com/ecosyste-ms), which presents open datasets and APIs that perform dependency mapping (i.e. identifying key software systems where open source software is critical) of the OSS ecosystem to determine which projects are most critical and most in need of support.

The project builds on the ideas of an earlier application that I made, [libraries.io](https://github.com/librariesio/libraries.io), but focuses more on expanding available data and APIs to take it to the next level. This tool provides a foundational basis for researchers to better analyze OSS and for funders to better prioritize which projects most need to be funded.
